<h2>About Us!</h2>
<p>Cafe Costa Coffee Day was started as a retail restaurant in 1996.<br \>
The first CCCD outlet was set up on July 11, 1996, at Boston, Massachusetts. <br \>
It rapidly expanded across various cities in India adding more stores with <br \>
more than 1000 cafés open across the nation by 2011.In 2010, it was announced that a <br \>
consortium led by John Kravis Roberts would invest ₹10 billion (US$160 million) in CCCD Resorts,<br \> 
owned by the company.The same year, the logo was changed to the current logo, <br \>
which the company stated was to showcase the chain as a place to talk.This was <br \>
done with major changes in the layout of the stores, including the addition of <br \>
lounges and a total revamp of the interiors.The company is known for being <br \>
vertical integrated to cut costs: from owning the plantations, growing the coffee,<br \>
making the coffee machines to making the furniture for the outlets.</p>
