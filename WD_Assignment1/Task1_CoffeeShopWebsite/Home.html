  <h2>Our Story!</h2>
  <p><span class="highlighter">CAFE COSTA COFFEE DAY</span> is pleased to be the first coffee shop in Downtown Boston <br \>
     to serve "Stumptown Coffee" and "Third Wave Coffee" products exclusively. <br \>
	 Stumptown, originating in Portland Oregon had been named "Best Coffee in the World" by NPR, <br \>
	 The New York Times, Food & Wine Magazine, and USA Today. To ensure exceptional quality and <br \>
	 freshness we obtain our beans directly from Stumptown's roasting facility in Brooklyn, New York.<br \>
	 Opened its doors in December 2010, Thinking Cup is ideally located just steps from the Boston Common. <br \>
	 We are committed to providing the premier coffee experience in Boston by serving <br \>
	 only the finest coffees, teas, and freshly baked pastries.
